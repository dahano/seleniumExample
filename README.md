# seleniumExample

 - This Selenium test-suite uses the Page Object Model (POM) pattern.
 - If you plan on pulling this project down, please checkout the TestSetup and configure your webdriver(s) appropriately. 
 - Once I've completed a few more tests, I'll go through and refactor some of the dupe code (DRY).
